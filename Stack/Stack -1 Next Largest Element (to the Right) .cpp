/*
Stack --Next Largest Element (Nearest Greater to Right) Problem : 

Problem: 
    We have given an array[] = 1 3 2 4
    Now we have to find greater element just right to the key element

    Let in above array we have given key = 3 now greater than 3 is 4 on its right side of array

    Or if we dont have any key, then we can find NGR of all the elements of the array

Approach:
    Brute Force : O(n^2)
    Stack Approach : O(n)

    Using Stack :
